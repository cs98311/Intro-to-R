### the guts of R

# assignment and calculator: how to assign values to variables,
# and make calculations with it

x <- 2
x <- 3 #it rewrites on top of the old value
y <- x + 10
z <- x - 2
i <- exp(2) #function exponential

rm(x) #remove variable

### logic
x <- 3
x > y # bigger than
x < y # smaller than
x == y # equal
x != y # non equal
